# Fraud Block
## Introduction
The Fraud Block project is an open source security tool for e-retailers. Its aim is to assist in identifying abnormal transactions for an e-commerce platform. It fills the gap of lacking free tools that can be made available to everyone to protect themselves from fraudulent transactions, solely using non-sensitive information.

This project was initiated as part of the master projects at ESME Paris, a French engineering school. The authors are *Illan Assuied*, *[Nikita Guery](https://github.com/gostravel)*, *Paul-Henri Lamarque*, and *[Eyal Wekstein](https://github.com/WeksteinEyal)*.
