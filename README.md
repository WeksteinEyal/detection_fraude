# Fraud Block
ðŸ‡«ðŸ‡· [Version franÃ§aise](README_FR.md)
## Introduction
The Fraud Block project is an open source security tool for e-retailers. Its aim is to assist in identifying abnormal transactions for an e-commerce platform. It fills the gap of lacking free tools that can be made available to everyone to protect themselves from fraudulent transactions, solely using non-sensitive information.

The application is compatible with Android, iOS, Windows, and MacOS. Due to funding constraints, it is currently only available for public access on [Android](#android) and [Windows](#windows) platforms.

This project was initiated as part of the master projects at ESME Paris, a French engineering school. The authors are *Illan Assuied*, *[Nikita Guery](https://github.com/gostravel)*, *Paul-Henri Lamarque*, and *[Eyal Wekstein](https://github.com/WeksteinEyal)*.

## Getting Started
One can use the [Fraud detector](#fraud-detector) after filling and sending its e-commerce informations from the [Profile](#profile) tab. These pieces of information are utilized to construct an AI model tailored to the user's e-commerce needs, capable of detecting any abnormal transactions. Data is not stored, and the model is saved on the user's device. This step requires an internet connection. Subsequently, the user can utilize the fraud detector without internet by inputting information from a suspicious transaction.

A [chatbot](#chatbot) is available to accompany the user during the application's usage, as well as to provide them with information on the topic of frauds.

From the [Services](#services) tab, the user can also verify if an email is listed on one or more sites affected by a data leak. Also it is possible to report an user or to check how many times an user has been reported.
